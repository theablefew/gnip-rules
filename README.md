# gnip-rules

Provides a quick and easy way to manage your rules via Gnip Rules API. 

## Installation

```ruby
 gem 'gnip-rules'
```

## Configuration

There are two ways you can provide credentials to the gnip-api gem. 

* Pass them to the initialize method

  `Gnip::Rules.new( "chieflarl@larlbang.com", "larl!operator" ,'https://api.gnip.com/.../YOUR_ACCOUNT/.../prod' )`

* Via a configuration file at config/gnip.yml 

```yaml
 development: &development
   username: chieflarl@larlbang.com
   password: larl!operator 
   api_url:'https://api.gnip.com:443/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT/publishers/twitter/streams/track/prod'
```

## Usage

```ruby
 @gnip_rules = Gnip::Rules.new
```

### Adding

```ruby
  rules = [Gnip::Rule.new "larl -bang", Gnip::Rule.new "#larloperator", Gnip::Rule.new "larlygag" , "some_tag"]
  response = @gnip_rules.add( rules )
  p response #=> 201 Created
```

### Removing

```ruby
  rules = [Gnip::Rule.new "larl -bang", Gnip::Rule.new "#larloperator"]
  response = @gnip_rules.remove( rules )
  p response #=> 200 OK
```

### Listing

```ruby
  response = @gnip_rules.list
  p response #=> {"rules": {"value":"larl -bang", "value":"#larloperator"} }
```

### Removing All Rules

This is really just for convienience while testing. You probably shouldn't ever use this in production.

```ruby
  response = @gnip_rules.delete_all!
  p response #=> 200 OK
  @gnip.list["rules"].empty? #=> true
```

## Running Tests

Make sure you have the config file mentioned above at config/gnip.yml

```ruby
 rake test
```

* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
